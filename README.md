# aisd22
The Project requires termcolor library for correct work https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/termcolor. Add this library to 'libs' in project's root by git clone.
mkatble.py and mktable2.py are scripts to make excel tables from saved data in cli.cpp.
After building the project run cli.exe for collecting data and then run mktable.exe for making excel tables if you need.
